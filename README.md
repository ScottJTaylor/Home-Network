# 🖥️ Home Server & Network Infrastructure

> **Portfolio Project** — Full-stack home lab design covering virtualisation, CCTV/NVR, structured cabling, firewall security, and WiFi infrastructure.

---

## 📋 Project Summary

A complete home server and network infrastructure build designed for security, scalability, and self-hosted services. The system is built around **Proxmox VE** as the hypervisor, **OPNsense** as the firewall, and **Frigate NVR** for AI-powered CCTV — all connected via structured Cat6A cabling with strict VLAN segmentation.

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Hypervisor** | Proxmox VE (KVM + LXC) |
| **Firewall** | OPNsense (IDS/IPS, WireGuard VPN) |
| **NVR** | Frigate + Google Coral TPU |
| **Camera Capacity** | 8–12 PoE IP cameras (ONVIF) |
| **VLAN Count** | 5 (LAN, CCTV, Servers, IoT, Guest) |
| **Cabling Standard** | Cat6A throughout (10GbE-ready) |
| **Estimated Budget** | ~$3,245–$4,810 |

### VLAN Segmentation

| VLAN | Subnet | Purpose | Internet |
|------|--------|---------|----------|
| VLAN 10 | 192.168.10.x | Main LAN — PCs, phones, laptops | ✅ Yes |
| VLAN 20 | 192.168.20.x | CCTV Cameras | ❌ Blocked |
| VLAN 30 | 192.168.30.x | Servers & Containers | ⚠️ Restricted |
| VLAN 40 | 192.168.40.x | IoT Devices | ⚠️ Restricted |
| VLAN 50 | 192.168.50.x | Guest WiFi | ✅ Internet only |

## 🔑 Key Design Decisions

- **Cameras isolated on VLAN 20** — no internet access, can only communicate with Frigate NVR container
- **ZFS storage backend** — data integrity, snapshots, and easy rollbacks via Proxmox
- **Google Coral USB TPU** — offloads AI inference from CPU at 8–12 camera scale
- **48-port patch panel** — all 12 camera runs and 8 room runs pre-allocated with room to grow
- **WireGuard VPN** — remote access without any open inbound ports
- **3-2-1 backup rule** — local ZFS + offsite Backblaze B2 via Duplicati/Restic
